**Description**

_Substitute this text with a concise description of the problem. Please be clear what parts of the problem are considered to be in-scope and out-of-scope._

_Example:_ Sometimes engine does not emit any tests. Seems that in such situations we can use a fuzzer.

**Expected behavior**

_Substitute the text with a clear and concise description of what you want to happen._

_Example:_ We can significantly improve coverage with a smart fuzzer. We can not only feed the API under test with a corner case data but analyze the control-flows graph in order to find additional data to fuzz.

**Environment**

_Substitute the text with steps to set up the environment for testing of the expected behavior._ 

_Example:_ You can execute test generation for a complex example. Stop the generation in several seconds after the start.

**Potential alternatives**

_Substitute this text with a potential alternative to the solution._

_Example:_ We can use simpler version of a fuzzer that just finds corner cases for primitives.

**Context**

_Substitute this text with information that can be crucial for understanding the problem._

_Example:_ fuzzing is the process of providing invalid, unexpected, or random data to a computer program. In context of UTBot, we are going to provide the data to the API under test.
