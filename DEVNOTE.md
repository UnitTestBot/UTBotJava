## Development of UTBot Java with IntelliJ IDEA

The majority of the code is written in Kotlin. 

The project is divided into Gradle subprojects. The most significant of them are: 
1. utbot-framework â€” all about the engine and tests for it

2. utbot-intellij â€” IDE plugin

3. utbot-sample â€” a framework with examples to demonstrate engine capacity
 
## Testing

The project contains many tests. They are usually placed in test root of the particular Gradle subproject.

While developing, it\`s useful to run tests from utbot-framework subproject. The majority of tests from this subproject generate tests for samples from the utbot-sample subproject.
