# What is UTBotJava?

UTBotJava generates test cases by code, trying to cover maximum statements and execution paths. We treat source code as source of truth assuming that behavior is correct and corresponds to initial user demand. Generated tests are placed in so-called regression suite. Thus, we fixate current behavior by generated test cases. Using UTBotJava developers obtain full control of their code. No future change can break the code without being noticed once it's covered with tests generated by UTBot. This way, modifications made by developers to an existing code are much safer. Hence, with the help of generated unit tests, UTBot provides dramatic code quality improvement.
