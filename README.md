# What is UnitTestBot?

UnitTestBot is the tool for **automated unit test generation** and **precise code analysis**. It produces ready-to-use 
test 
cases for 
Java ‚Äî with 
valid inputs and comments. It can even predict whether the tests fail or pass. You can analyze them, run them, show coverage ‚Äî as if you've created them personally.

The **symbolic execution engine** paired with a **smart fuzzing technique** constitutes the core of UnitTestBot. It helps to **find errors** and **prevent regressions** in the code in a much more efficient way ‚Äî UnitTestBot **maximizes path coverage** while **minimizing the number of tests and false positives**.

UnitTestBot represents all the test summaries in a **human-readable format**. The intelligible test method names and comments help you to control the whole testing process. Test failed? The summary refers you to the related branch or the condition under test.

# Get started

Try the **[online demo](https://www.utbot.org/demo)** to generate unit tests with one click.

  <summary>Generate tests with default configuration</summary>

Proceed to generating unit tests for the existing Java project. If you don't have one, create it using the [JetBrains tutorial](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-running-your-first-java-application.html).

1. Open your Java project in IntelliJ IDEA. 
2. Right-click the required package or a file in the Project tool window, scroll the menu down to the bottom and 
   choose **Generate Tests with UnitTestBot...**
3. In the **Generate Tests with UnitTestBot** window tick the classes or methods you'd like to cover with unit tests and 
   press **Generate Tests** or **Generate and Run**.

Now you can see the resulting test class or classes in the Editor tool window.

Need to configure testing framework, mocking strategy or parameterization? Please check all [configuration options](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotJava/wiki/Fine-tune-test-generation).

  <summary>Make use of generated tests</summary>

What can you do with the output?

1. To *find and fix the errors* in your code:

* Run the generated tests: right-click the test class or a folder with tests and choose **Run**.

* In the Run tool window you can see the tests failed with the brief failure explanation.

* Fix your errors if needed.

2. To *prevent regressions*:

* Having your errors fixed, run the tests again. "Passed"? Commit them as the regression suite.

* Introduce changes in the code and run your tests as often as needed!

* Tests failed? Decide whether it is a bug or a feature and generate new tests if necessary.

3. To *view coverage*:

Right-click the test class, choose **More Run/Debug > Run ... with Coverage**.
