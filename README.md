# What is UTBot Java?
UTBot Java is the tool for **automated unit test generation**. It produces ready-to-use test cases for Java ‚Äî with valid inputs and comments. It can even predict whether the tests fail or pass. You can analyze them, run them, show coverage ‚Äî as if you've created them personally.

The **symbolic execution engine** paired with a **smart fuzzing technique** constitutes the core of UTBot Java. It helps to **find errors** and **prevent regressions** in the code in a much more efficient way ‚Äî UTBot Java **maximizes path coverage** while **minimizing the number of tests and false positives**.

UTBot Java represents all the test summaries in a **human-readable format**. The intelligible test method names and comments help you to control the whole testing process. Test failed? The summary refers you to the related branch or the condition under test.

# Get started
Try the **[online demo](https://www.utbot.org/utbot/)** to generate unit tests with one click.

Get to know the **full version** of UTBot Java plugin with this quick guide:

<details>
  <summary>Install UTBot Java plugin for IntelliJ IDEA</summary>

Try the most straightforward path to start using UTBot plugin.
1. Open your IntelliJ IDEA. If you don't have one, get it from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows).
2. Go to **File ‚Üí Settings... ‚Üí Plugins ‚Üí Marketplace**.
3. In the search field type *UTBot* ‚Äî you'll see the UnitTestBot plugin page.

  <summary>Generate tests with default configuration</summary>

Proceed to generating unit tests for the existing Java project. If you don't have one, create it using the [JetBrains tutorial](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-running-your-first-java-application.html).

1. Open your Java project in IntelliJ IDEA. 
2. Right-click the required package or a file in the Project tool window, scroll the menu down to the bottom and choose **Create Tests with UTBot...**
3. In the **Generate tests with UTBot** window tick the classes or methods you'd like to cover with unit tests and press **OK**.

Now you can see the resulting test class or classes in the Editor tool window.

<details>
  <summary>Make use of generated tests</summary>

What can you do with the output?

1. To *find and fix the errors* in your code:

* Run the generated tests: right-click the test class or a folder with tests and choose **Run**.

* In the Run tool window you can see the tests failed with the brief failure explanation.

* Fix your errors if needed.

2. To *prevent regressions*:

* Having your errors fixed, run the tests again. "Passed"? Commit them as the regression suite.

* Introduce changes in the code and run your tests as often as needed!

* Tests failed? Decide whether it is a bug or a feature and generate new tests if necessary.

3. To *view coverage*:

Right-click the test class, choose **More Run/Debug ‚Üí Run ... with Coverage**.
