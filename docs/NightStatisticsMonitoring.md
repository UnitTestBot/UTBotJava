# Night Statistics Monitoring

## What is the problem?

As UnitTestBot contributors, we'd like to constantly improve our product. There are many of us introducing code changes simultaneously â€” unfortunately, some changes or combinations of them may lead to reduced plugin efficiency. To avoid such an unlucky result we need to monitor statistics on test generation performance.

## Why monitor nightly?

It would be great to collect statistics as soon as the contributor changes the code. In case you have a huge project it takes too long to run the monitoring system after each push into master.
Thus, we decided to do it every night when (hopefully!) no one makes changes.

## How do we collect statistics?

To find the algorithm you can refer to `StatisticsMonitoring.kt`. Shortly speaking, it is based on `ContestEstimator.kt`, which runs test generation on the sample projects and then compile the resulting tests. We repeat the whole process several times to reduce measurement error.

## Statistics monitoring usage

### Collecting statistics

To run statistics monitoring you have to specify the name of the JSON output file.

Input arguments: `<output json>`.

Output format: you get the JSON file, which contains an array of objects with statistics and input parameters on each run.

More about each statistic: `Statistics.kt`.

More about monitoring settings: `MonitoringSettings.kt`.

Input example:

```
stats.json
```

Output example (the result of three runs during one night):

```json5
[
  {
    "parameters": {
      "fuzzing_ratio": 0.1, // how long does fuzzing takes
      "class_timeout_sec": 20, // test generation timeout for one class
      "run_timeout_min": 20 // total timeout for this run
    },
    "targets": [ // projects that have been processed

            }
          },
          // ...
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Metadata

Our main goal is to find code changes or run conditions related to the reduced UnitTestBot performance. Thus, we collect metadata about each run: the commit hash, the UnitTestBot build number, and also information about the environment (including JDK and build system versions, and other parameters).

The `insert_metadata.py` script is responsible for doing this. To run it you have to specify the following arguments.

To get more information about input arguments call script with option `--help`.

Output format: you get the JSON file, containing metadata, statistics and parameters grouped by target project and classes.

Input example:
```
--stats_file stats.json --output_file data/meta-stats.json
--commit 66a1aeb6 --branch main
--build 2022.8 --timestamp 1661330445 
--source_type github-action --source_id 2917672580
```

Output example (statistics followed by metadata):

  "targets": [ // projects and methods that have been processed
    {

### Datastorage structure

We store the collected statistics in our repository. You can find two special branches: `monitoring-data` and `monitoring-aggregated-data`.

The `monitoring-data` branch is a storage for raw statistics data as well as metadata.

The filename format: `<yyyy>-<mm>-<dd>-<hh>-<MM>-<ss>-<branch>-<short commit hash>-<runner number>.json`

### Grafana

#### Usage

We can use [Grafana](https://monitoring.utbot.org) for more dynamic and detailed statistics visualisation. Grafana pulls data from our repository automatically.

#### Metrics format

Our goal after collecting statistics is uploading results into grafana. For this we should prepare data and send it to our server.

The `prepare_metrics.py` script is responsible for doing this. To run it you have to specify the following arguments.

To get more information about input arguments call script with option `--help`.

Output format: you get the JSON file, containing array of metrics with some labels.

Output example:
```json5
[
  // summarised
  {
    "metric": "testcases_generated",
    "labels": {
      "project": "guava",
      "fuzzing_ratio": 0.1
    },
    "value": 1024
  },
  // ...
  // by classes
  {
    "metric": "testcases_generated",
    "labels": {
      "project": "guava",
      "class": "com.google.common.math.LongMath",
      "fuzzing_ratio": 0.1
    },
    "value": 91
  },
  // ...
]
```
