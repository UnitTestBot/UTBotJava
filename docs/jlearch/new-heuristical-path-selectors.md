# GreedySearch

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class GreedySearch{
        -Set~ExecutionState~ states
        +ExecutionState.weight
    }
    GreedySearch --|> BasePathSelector
```
Base methods such as `offer` or `remove` is implemented pretty simple and just a delegation to `states`.

In `peekImpl` we find the set of `states` with maximum `weight` and peek random among them, so to use this class in implementation of some `pathSelector`, you just need to override an `ExecutionState.weight`.

# SubpathStatistics

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class SubpathStatistics{
        +int index
        -Map~Subpath, Int~ subpathCount
        subpathCount(ExecutionState)
    }
    class TraverseGraphStatistics{
        onVisit(ExecutionState)
    }
    
    SubpathStatistics --|> TraverseGraphStatistics
    TraverseGraphStatistics o-- InterProceduralUnitGraph
```
`Subpath` = `List<Edge>`

This class maintains frequency of each subpath with length `2^index`, which is presented as `List<Edge>`, in a certain instance of `InterproceduralUnitGraph`

* `onVisit(state: ExecutionState)` - we calculate subpath of this state and increment its frequency on `1`
* `subpathCount(state: ExecutionState)` - we calculate subpath of this state and return its frequency

# SubpathGuidedSelector

```mermaid
classDiagram
    SubpathGuidedSelector o-- SubpathStatistics
    SubpathGuidedSelector --|> GreedySearch
```

Inspired by [paper](http://pxzhang.cn/paper/concolic_testing/oopsla13-pgse.pdf).

We override `ExecutionState.weight` as `-StatementStatistics.subpathCount(this)`, so we pick the `state`, which `subpath` is less traveled.

# StatementStatistics

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class StatementStatistics{
        -Map~Stmt, Int~ statementsCount
        -Map~SootMethod, Int~ statementsInMethodCount
        +statementCount(ExecutionState)
        +statementsInMethodCount(ExecutionState)
    }
    
    class TraverseGraphStatistics{
        onVisit(ExecutionState)
    }
    
    StatementStatistics --|> TraverseGraphStatistics
    TraverseGraphStatistics o-- InterProceduralUnitGraph
```

This class maintains frequency of each `Stmt` and number of `Stmt`, that was visited in some `SootMethod`, on a certain instance of `InterproceduralUnitGraph`.

* `onVisit(state: ExecutionState)` - increment frequency of state's `stmt` on 1. If we visit this `stmt` for the first time, then increment number of `Stmt`, that we visit in the current state's `method`, on 1.
* `statementCount(state: ExecutionState)` - get a frequency of state's `stmt`
* `statementsInMethodCount(state: ExecutionState)` - get number of `stmt`, that was visited in the current state's `method`.

# CPInstSelector

```mermaid
classDiagram
    CPInstSelector o-- StatementStatistics
    CPInstSelector --|> NonUniformRandomSearch
```

Override `ExecutionState.cost` as `StatementStatistics.statementInMethodCount(this)`, so we are more likely to explore the least explored `method`.

# ForkDepthSelector

```mermaid
classDiagram
    ForkDepthSelector --|> NonUniformRandomSearch
```

Override `ExecutionState.cost` as `ExecutionState.depth`, so we are more likely to explore the least deep `state` in terms of the number of forks on its path.
