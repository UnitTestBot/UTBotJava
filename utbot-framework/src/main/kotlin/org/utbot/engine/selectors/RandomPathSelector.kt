/**
 * Stores all the states in procedure graph, where
 * each node and path from root to this node correspond
 * to statement in the program and execution trace from
 * starting point of method to this statement respectively.
 *
 * On selecting next state this class walks from root
 * to one of the leaves in procedure tree and each time chooses
 * random branch.
 *
 * It differs from selecting universally distributed state (RandomSelector)
 * in that the state with lower path length has more chances to
 * be selected.
 *
 * Also it differs from NURS:Depth in that states in each
 * fork of execution resources are equally shared between
 * branches despite of the number of states in these branches.
 *
 * For example, when we choose random path at some iteration
 * with following case, the probability to choose one of the
 * the branches is 0.5, even despite the fact that at the
 * right branch there are 100 times more executionStates than
 * at the left branch:
 *                 ┌──────────────┐
 *                 │fork statement│
 *                 └──────────────┘
 *                  /            \
 *              (p0=0.5)       (p1=0.5)
 *                /                \
 * ┌─────────────────┐          ┌────────────────────┐
 * │10 executionState│          │1000 executionStates│
 * │ in left branch  │          │  in right branch   │
 * └─────────────────┘          └────────────────────┘
 *
 * So, if at the some point there will be condition that splits
 * execution graph into 2 parts of code, one of that generates
 * an enormous number of execution states.
 * Using this strategy, we will select execution states equally
 * between these blocks; not between all the other execution states.
