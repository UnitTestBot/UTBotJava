 * Execution states are weighted as follows:

 * if (exState.edges contains uncovered stmt) then
 *      1.0 / (lenMetric + 1)
 * else

 *
 * By using this selector we select execution states according to assumption that
 * execution states that are closest to uncovered statements are more likely
 * to reach new coverage and also taking into the account currently uncovered
 * statements that occurs in path.
