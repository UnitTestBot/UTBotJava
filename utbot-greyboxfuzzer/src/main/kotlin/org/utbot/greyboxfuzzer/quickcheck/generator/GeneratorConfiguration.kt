 * If a generator has a public instance method named `configure`,
 * with a single parameter whose type is an annotation that has this annotation
 * applied, then when a property that has a parameter marked with method that
 * annotation is verified, the generator that generates the value for that
 * parameter will have its `configure` method called with the annotation
